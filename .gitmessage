#ext4: Add support for case-insensitive file names
#
#This patch adds support for case-insensitive file names to the ext4 filesystem. This is useful for users who are migrating from a case-insensitive filesystem like NTFS or HFS+ to ext4, and want to preserve the case-insensitivity of their file names.
#
#The new feature is implemented using a new mount option, "case_insensitive", which can be set at mount time or in /etc/fstab. When this option is enabled, file names in the ext4 filesystem will be treated as case-insensitive, so that files with the same name but different case will be treated as the same file.
#```
#
#(thats all for a great work flow
